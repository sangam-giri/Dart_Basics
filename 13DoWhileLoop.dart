// Do While Loop 

/*Do while Loop is somewhat similar to While Loop. 
The difference is there is a Do condition and then only the While condition,
Meaning the program first does something and then only check whether to run the loop further or not,
Here the do condition is important and while determines if whether to run the loop any further or not*/

void main(){
  int i = 1;
  do{
    print(i);
    i++;
  }
  while(i<=10);
    // We are calling calc inside main function if we don't functions other that main won't run
  calc();
  }


  int calc(){
    var a =1;
    do{
      print("Sangam");
      a++;
    }while(a<=10);

    return 0;
  }

  /*Be wise on using Do While loop. And that is because unlike while loop. Do while loop runs atleast once*/
