// Varibles are the conatiner that stores the values. Dart is smart language thus identifies the data type of the value assigned to a variable 

var name = "Modern Technology";
var address = "Washington";
var services = ["Mobile development", "Web Development", "Desktop Application Development"];
var estDate = DateTime(2022);

void main(){
  print(estDate.year); //onl prints the year from the est date

}

// What is the purpose of learning var ??
// Answer: We do not have to specify the date type of the value or the data we are inserting or introducing to Dart
